The Rubik's cube was one of my favorite toys as a child, and writing an animated 3d cube was my dream project at the age of 18. This repo shows the result of that effort.

The code was written in Borland C in an old 486 machine. I found the archives of this project in 2021 and made it available in Dosbox.

# Developing, building, playing around

I use a mac, so scripts work on the mac only... You need to have node and npm installed. 
If you want to play with the source code, put [dosbox.app](https://www.dosbox.com/) in the root of the repository.

```
    npm run build:  creates a rubik.zip file in the public folder.
    npm run dosbox: opens dosbox with Borland C and Norton Commander installed.
```
