NC_EXIT.COM          Program and documentation by Tony McNamara, Symantec

Purpose:
========
    Unloads the Norton Commander without the use of a TSR program.
    Optionally stuffs up to an 11 character command for processing after.

Version 2.0, 1 February 91
    Added command-line string parameter support.

Syntax:
=======
    NC_EXIT
    or
    NC_EXIT <string> 
    where <string> is up to 11 characters to be entered, as if typed at the
    keyboard, after The Norton Commander has been exited.  

Compatibility:
==============
    Unloads only the Norton Commander.  
    Windows compatible.
    Designed to be highly compatible.
    May be rendered ineffective by some keyboard accelerators.

Usage:
======
    Call from a batch file or a sequence of commands in a user menu.
    No parameters are required.  If given, an ASCII string is used.
    Due to the method, NC_Exit should be the last command called by the user 
    menu or batch file.  Otherwise, the keyboard input may be accepted or reset
    by another program.
    IMPORTANT: Both NC_Exit and the batch file or executable called by 
               <string> should be in your PATH.  Otherwise, these won't
               work.  You probably should put them in your Norton Commander
               directory, which should already be in your PATH.
    
EXAMPLES:
=========
        To run Windows from outside of the Commander, you could set
	the user menu to:
        W:      MS Windows
                nc_exit win
    (assuming WIN.COM was in your path).  Then, whenever you chose Windows
    at your user menu, you would leave the Commander and run MS Windows without
    it.

        
    To change the PATH in NC and have it stick (as opposed to merely staying
    in effect for the duration of a batch file), you must exit NC, set the 
    path, and restart NC.  This can now be automated by doing the following:

        1) Create a two line batch file, consisting of:
                PATH=<the path you wish set>
                NC

        2) Set your User Menu, Extension Files, or whatever batch file is
           called by these to call NC_EXIT <batch file name>

        For example, call the following "SETNC.BAT"
                SET NORCMD=ON
                NC
        and add the following to your User Menu:
                T:      Test NC_Exit
                        NC_EXIT SETNC
        Then select "T" from your user menu.  You should wind right back
        in the Commander, but when you type "SET", you should see the
        new environmental variable "NORCMD".
